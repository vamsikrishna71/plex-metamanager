Plex-Meta-Manager provides an extensive collection of "default" metadata files.

These files provide a simple way for you to create collections based on franchises or awards or actors, etc.

The default config links to two of them:

```
      - pmm: basic
      - pmm: imdb
```

The first will create:

  - Newly Released
  - New Episodes [TV libraries only]

The second will create:

  - IMDb Popular
  - IMDb Top 250
  - IMDb Lowest Rated
