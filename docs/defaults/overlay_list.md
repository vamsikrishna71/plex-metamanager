## Overlays

These files apply overlays and can generally be used on both Movie and Show library-types, and often works at the season and episode-level too.

It should be noted that when an overlay has &#10071; for a season or episode, it normally means that whilst the overlay can technically be applied at the level, it wasn't designed for this purpose. For example, a show's season cannot have a resolution since it is not a video file, and an episode cannot have a commonsense age-rating since only Movies and Shows are rated by CommonSense. 

In the scenario where there is missing data such as age ratings for episodes, then generally the highest-level data available will be applied at the lower level (i.e. a Show's CommonSense age rating would apply to all episodes).

These overlays are applied by calling the below paths into the `overlay_path` [section](../config/libraries.md#overlay-path) of your config.yml
