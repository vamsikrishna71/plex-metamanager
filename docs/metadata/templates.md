# Templates

Collection and Overlay Definitions often share a lot of common or generalizable configuration details. Templates allow you to define these details so they can be used across multiple definitions.

For example, an actor collection might look like this:

```yaml
collections:
  Bruce Lee:
    plex_search:
      all:
        actor: tmdb
    tmdb_person: 19429
    sort_title: !_Bruce Lee
    sync_mode: sync
    collection_order: release
```

Then you add another:

```yaml
collections:
  Bruce Lee:
    plex_search:
      all:
        actor: tmdb
    tmdb_person: 19429
    sort_title: !_Bruce Lee
    sync_mode: sync
    collection_order: release
  Chris Pratt:
    plex_search:
      all:
        actor: tmdb
    tmdb_person: 73457
    sort_title: !_Chris Pratt
    sync_mode: sync
    collection_order: release
```

You could keep going in this way, but there's a lot of repetition there. Both of these collections have the same `sync_mode`, `collection_order`, and `actor` settings; the other two details, `tmdb_person` and `sort_title`, depend on a value defined in the collection.

Those repetitive aspects can be moved into a template and leveraged by multiple collections.

## Template Variables

Template Variables are used to define the data that going to be changing in the template.

For example, a template for those two collections might look like this:

```yaml
templates:
  Actor:
    plex_search:
      all:
        actor: tmdb
    tmdb_person: <<person>>
    sort_title: !_<<collection_name>>
    sync_mode: sync
    collection_order: release
```

The only things that change are the ID that is used with `tmdb_person` and the name of the collection that is used in `sort_title`.

Those two things surrounded by `<< >>` are "template variables" that you can define for any collection using this template, like this:

```yaml
collections:
  Chris Pratt:
    template:
      name: Actor
      person: 73457
```

or to do it in a single line you can do this 

```yaml
collections:
  Bruce Lee:
    template: {name: Actor, person: 19429}
```

Note that we provide the template name `Actor` and the value to insert in the place of `<<person>>`. The `<<collection_name>>` is a template variable that is always available and doesn't have to be called out like `<<person>>`.

Inside a template, you can use all the Builders, Details, and [Filters](filters) attributes that you can give collections/playlists [except `template`; templates cannot be nested].

The names of template variables that you define are arbitrary. In the example above, `<<person>>` could have been `<<tvdb_person_id>>` or `<<bing>>` or anything else. The only thing that matters is that in the template definition you surround them with `<< >>` and in the collection definition you spell it correctly.

To use a template with a collection definition you use the `template` attribute. The only required attribute under `template` is `name` which must correspond exactly to the template mapping name. Any other attributes under `template` are considered template variables whose names correspond exactly with the template variable name surrounded by `<<` and `>>` in the templates. These template variables will replace any part of any value that contains the template variable name surrounded by `<<` and `>>` in the template with the specified template variable's value.

Here's the full example Actor template and two different ways to use it, as it would appear in a metadata file.

```yaml
templates:
  Actor:
    plex_search:
      all:
        actor: tmdb
    tmdb_person: <<person>>
    sort_title: !_<<collection_name>>
    sync_mode: sync
    collection_order: release
collections:
  Bruce Lee:
    template: {name: Actor, person: 19429}
  Chris Pratt:
    template:
      name: Actor
      person: 73457
```

## Multi-Template Variables

When using multiple Templates in a single definition you can send the same variable to all templates by using the `variables` attribute.

```yaml
templates:
  Actor:
    plex_search:
      all:
        actor: tmdb
    tmdb_person: <<person>>
    sort_title: !_<<collection_name>>
  Common:
    summary: "Movies that <<collection_name>> (TMDb ID: <<person>>) are in"
    sync_mode: sync
    collection_order: release
collections:
  Bruce Lee:
    variables: {person: 19429}
    template: [{name: Actor}, {name: Common}]
  Chris Pratt:
    variables:
      person: 19429
    template:
     - name: Actor
     - name: Common
```

## Special Template Attributes

There are some attributes unique to `templates`; `default`, `optional`, `conditionals`, and `move_prefix`.

* `default` can set default values for template variables to be used if they're not specified in the call.
* `optional` can specify variables that if not specified on the template call will cause any attribute using one of those variables to be ignored in the template. You can make any template variable optional per collection by setting it to `null`.
* `conditionals` can specify variables based on conditions set by the user. See more [here](#conditionals)
* `move_prefix` can be given a list or comma-separated string of prefixes to move to the end of the collection/playlist name for sorting.
    i.e. If you have `move_prefix: The` and a collection is called `The Avengers` then `<<collection_sort>>` is replaced with `Avengers, The` instead of `The Avengers` for that collection.

Every template call is given these template variables.

* Either `<<collection_name>>`, `<<playlist_name>>`, or `<<overlay_name>>` which is the name of the definition.
* `<<mapping_name>>` is the original mapping name for the definition in the YAML file.
* Either `<<collection_sort>>` or `<<playlist_sort>>` which is the name of the definition after `move_prefix` is applied.
* `<<library_type>>` which is the library type
* `<<library_name>>` which is the name of the library
* All Template Variables can append `_encoded` to the variable name to use a URL encode version of the variable. ex. `<<collection_name_encoded>>`

### Conditionals 

Each conditional is identified by its mapping name and has one required attribute; `conditions` and one optional attribute; `default`.

`default` is the default value for the variable when no condition is met. If default is not specified the variable becomes an optional variable.

`conditions` is a list of sets of conditions where if all conditions are met then the variable will be the `value` specified in that condition.

Each set of conditions must have the `value` attribute which is the value of the variable if the condition is met. 

All other attribute pairs in the set of conditions will check some condition of the value of the attribute key:

* If the attribute key ends with `.not` the value must not equal the attribute value or not be in the list of attribute values.
* If the attribute key ends with `.exists` and the attribute value is `true` then the attribute key must be a given template variable and if the value is anything else then the attribute key must not be a given template variable.
* Otherwise, the value must equal the attribute value or be in the list of attribute values.

Here's an example from the [PMM Default ratings file](https://github.com/meisnate12/Plex-Meta-Manager/blob/master/defaults/overlays/ratings.yml).

```yaml
templates:
  Rating:
    conditionals:
      rating1_horizontal_offset:
        default: 30             # If no condition sets below are meet
        conditions:
          - side: [top, bottom]
            rating2: none
            rating3: none
            value: 0            # If side is 'top' or 'bottom' and rating2 is 'none' and rating3 is 'none'
          - side: [top, bottom]
            rating2: none
            value: -165         # If side is 'top' or 'bottom' and rating2 is 'none' and no previous conditions are meet
          - side: [top, bottom]
            rating3: none
            value: -165         # If side is 'top' or 'bottom' rating3 is 'none' and no previous conditions are meet
          - side: [top, bottom]
            value: -335         # If side is 'top' or 'bottom' and no previous conditions are meet
```

## Advanced Example

Here's an example IMDb Genre template and two different ways to call it.

```yaml
templates:
  IMDb Genre:
    default:
      title: feature
      limit: 100
    optional:
      - poster_id
    imdb_list:
    - url: https://www.imdb.com/search/title/?title_type=<<title>>&release_date=1990-01-01,&user_rating=5.0,10.0&num_votes=100000,&genres=<<genre>>
      limit: <<limit>>
    - url: https://www.imdb.com/search/title/?title_type=<<title>>&release_date=1990-01-01,&user_rating=5.0,10.0&num_votes=100000,&genres=<<genre>>&sort=user_rating,desc
      limit: <<limit>>
    sort_title: !_<<collection_name>>
    url_poster: https://theposterdb.com/api/assets/<<poster_id>>
    sync_mode: sync
    collection_order: alpha
collections:
  Action:
    template:
      name: IMDb Genre
      genre: action
    summary: Action film is a genre wherein physical action takes precedence in the storytelling. The film will often have continuous motion and action including physical stunts, chases, fights, battles, and races. The story usually revolves around a hero that has a goal, but is facing incredible odds to obtain it.
  Comedy:
    template: {name: IMDb Genre, genre: comedy, poster_id: 69200}
    summary: Comedy is a genre of film that uses humor as a driving force. The aim of a comedy film is to illicit laughter from the audience through entertaining stories and characters. Although the comedy film may take on some serious material, most have a happy ending. Comedy film has the tendency to become a hybrid sub-genre because humor can be incorporated into many other genres. Comedies are more likely than other films to fall back on the success and popularity of an individual star.
  Romantic Comedy:
    template: {name: IMDb Genre, genre: "romance,comedy", limit: 200}
    summary: Romantic Comedy is a genre that attempts to catch the viewer’s heart with the combination of love and humor. This sub-genre is light-hearted and usually places the two protagonists in humorus situation. Romantic-Comedy film revolves around a romantic ideal, such as true love. In the end, the ideal triumphs over the situation or obstacle, thus creating a happy ending.
    filters:
      genre: Comedy

## External Templates

To load external templates located in another file you can use the `external_templates` attribute by specifying the path type and path of the files that will be executed. See [Path Types](../config/paths) for how to define them.

```yaml
external_templates:
  - file: config/templates.yml       
  - pmm: templates
```
