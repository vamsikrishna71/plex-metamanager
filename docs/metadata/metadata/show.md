# TV Show Library Metadata

You can have the script edit the metadata of Shows, Seasons, and Episodes by adding them to the `metadata` mapping of a Metadata File.

An example of multiple metadata edits in a show library is below:
```yaml
metadata:
  "Avatar: The Last Airbender":
    sort_title: Avatar 01
    seasons:
      1:
        title: "Book One: Water"
        summary: >-
              After a lapse of 100 years, the Avatar-spiritual master of the elements-has returned. And just in
              the nick of time. The Four Nations (Water, Earth, Fire, and Air) have become unbalanced. The Fire
              Nation wants to rule the world, and its first conquest will be the Northern Water Tribe. It's up to
              a 12-year-old Airbender named Aang to find a way to stop it. Join Aang, Katara, Sokka, Momo, and
              Appa as they head north on the adventure of a lifetime.

        summary: >-
              Avatar Aang continues his quest to master the four elements before the end of summer. Together with
              Katara, Sokka, Momo, and Appa, he journeys across the Earth Kingdom in search of an Earthbending
              mentor. Along the way, he confronts Princess Azula, treacherous  daughter of Firelord Ozai and
              sister to Prince Zuko. More powerful than her brother, Azula will stop nothing to defeat the Avatar.
              But Aang and the gang find plenty of Earth Kingdom allies to help them along the way. From the swamps
              of the South to the Earth King's palace, Avatar: Book 2 is an adventure like no other.
      3:
        title: "Book Three: Fire"
        summary: >-
              Having survived the terrible battle with Azula, Aang faces new challenges as he and his brave
              friends secretly enter the Fire Nation. Their quest is to find and defeat Firelord Ozai. Along
              the way, they discover that Ozai has plans of his own. The leader of the Fire Nation intends to
              use the massive power of Sozin's comet to spread his dominion permanently across the four nations.
              Short on time, Aang has a lot of bending to learn and no master to help him learn it. However, his
              friends are there to help, and he finds unexpected allies deep in the heart of the Fire Nation. In
              the spectacular four-part conclusion, Aang must fulfill his destiny and become a fully realized
              Avatar, or watch the world go up in smoke.

## Shows

Each metadata definition is defined by the mapping name which can link to a show in multiple ways.

* Mapping name must match the show name in Plex exactly unless an `alt_title` is specified.
* Mapping name must match the TVDb ID or IMDb ID mapped to the show.

**Note:** to search for a show titled with a number surround the number in quotes like in the example below.

```yaml
metadata:
  Game of Thrones:  # Matches via the Name "Game of Thrones"
    edits...
  366524:           # Matches via TVDb ID: 366524
    edits...
  tt10234724:       # Matches via IMDb ID: tt10234724
    edits...
  "24":             # Matches via the Name "24" 
    edits...
```

### Seasons

To edit the metadata of a particular Season in a Show use the `seasons` attribute on its show.

The mapping name is the season number (use 0 for specials) or the season name.

### Episodes

To edit the metadata of a particular Episode in a Season use the `episodes` attribute on its season.

The mapping name is the episode number in that season or the title of the episode.

## Metadata Edits

The available attributes for editing shows, seasons, and episodes are as follows
